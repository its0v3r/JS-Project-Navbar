This project is a navbar. It was written only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

This project is heavily based on John Smilga's Navbar project on his HTML/CSS/JS course ([Codding Addict](https://www.youtube.com/c/codingaddict)). But it might have a few or a lot of tweaks and new things added by me.

# Project Features

-   Navbar toggle functionality works using height to prevent transition animations inconsistence;
-   If the navbar is toggled, when the screen resizes to 800px or above, the navbar will be hidden when resizing back to bellow 800px;
